React To Do List App

# Purpose

A to do list app that has been created using the React framework. This has been created as a comparison to the previous to do list app created in plain JavaScript

# Summary

This application was built in comparison to another To Do list app I created in plain JavaScript. This to do list created in react was easier to built and manage. Using a state within the root component "App" and "AddForm" we are able to hold tasks that are currently required to be completed and new tasks

# Hurdles

Found that having Knowledge of the JavaScript methods such as filter were helpful to create a array that works for the removal of the compeleted tasks.
